# Data Science for Business using Python
This is an introductory basic course for students to understand the first concepts of the data science life cycle in delivering insights and value for business using data through the use of Python to wrangle and publish results.

The pedagogy style of this course is “learning by doing”, therefore besides the basic concepts the classes are demonstration and follow through exercises that students have to complete. This is a 100% hands on course where the classes, tutorials assignments and tests all require programming. No programming background is assumed but it is necessary that the student is willing to learn through the class, collaboration and research.
